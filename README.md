# Auto Label Fake Review

This project is designed to automatically label reviews as fake or real based on predefined criteria using a Python-based system. The criteria for determining whether a review is fake are encoded into the system, allowing for consistent and automated labeling.

## Features

1. <strong>Automated Labeling:</strong> Automatically labels reviews based on specific criteria such as sentiment inconsistency, ambiguity, and other user-defined rules.
2. <strong>Python Implementation:</strong> The system is built using Python, ensuring flexibility and ease of customization.
3. <strong>Predefined Criteria:</strong> The labeling rules are predefined but can be easily modified to suit different datasets or requirements.
